## 🛠️ Bot Anatomy  

Passion is a **node-based chatbot**, meaning that conversations flow from **one entry point** to another based on **user actions**. Below is the core architecture:  

### 🔹 **Nodes & Flow**  
- Each conversation **begins at an entry point** and moves **node-to-node**.  
- The bot **follows user inputs** to determine the next logical step.  

### 🔹 **Triggers**  
- **Define how conversations start** (e.g., user sends a message, selects a choice, or triggers an event).  
- Examples: "Hello", "Start", or a **WhatsApp message** received.  

### 🔹 **Events**  
- Events handle **real-time interactions**, such as API responses, webhook triggers, or system notifications.  
- Example: A **database query returns data**, and Passion uses that to **continue the conversation**.  

### 🔹 **Memory & Context**  
- The bot **remembers user inputs** within the session, allowing for **context-aware conversations**.

    C -->|Returns Data| D[Response to User]
    D --> E[Next Interaction]
    E -->|Loop| B
```
## 💡 How It Works  

Passion operates as a **node-based chatbot**, meaning conversations follow a **structured flow**, transitioning between different **nodes** based on user interactions.  

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Process  

1️⃣ **User initiates a conversation**  
   - A **trigger** (e.g., a message, button click, or system event) activates Passion.  

2️⃣ **Node-based navigation**  
   - Passion moves through **predefined conversation paths** based on **user input and system logic**.  

3️⃣ **Decision-making**  
   - Conditions determine **which path** the conversation follows (e.g., user choices, API responses).  

4️⃣ **Execution of actions**  
   - Passion can **send emails, fetch database records, recognize speech, or play music**, depending on the interaction.  

5️⃣ **Real-time response generation**  
   - Using **GPT-4 and NLP techniques**, Passion **understands context** and responds dynamically.
